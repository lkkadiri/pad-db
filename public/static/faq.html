        <h1>Professional Tile Cleaning</h1>
            <h3>What is pool tile bead blasting?</h3>
                <p>Pool tile bead blasting is a process by which we use state-of-the-art equipment to remove calcium build-up and stains from your swimming pool tile, rock, stone and more!</p>
            <h3>What kind of beads do you use for pool tile bead blasting?</h3>
                <p>We use glass beads to remove calcium and mineral build-up, hard water stains and chemical residue from your pool tiles.</p>
            <h3>What is pool tile bead blasting?</h3>
                <p>Pool tile bead blasting is a process by which we use state-of-the-art equipment to remove calcium build-up and stains from your swimming pool tile, rock, stone and more!</p>
            <h3>Why do you use glass beads for pool tile cleaning?</h3>
                <p>Glass beads are environmentally friendly and will not damage your swimming pool tile during the cleaning process. The beads are manufactured from silica- and lead-free glass and are round in shape. Because of their spherical shape, the beads are able to hit the tile surface without scratching or damaging it. Glass beads provide the best pool tile cleaning results. They are more effective and safer than harsh chemicals, and will save you time and money over pumice stones.</p>
           <h3>Won’t the glass beads make a mess in my swimming pool?</h3>
                <p>No. Glass beads will sink to the bottom of your pool during the pool bead blasting process. Once we’re finished blasting, we use a portable suction device to vacuum the beads out of your pool. We do not leave the glass beads in your pool because they may clog your existing filtration system. With our pool tile bead blasting method, there’s no mess!</p>
           <h3>Do you clean other types of surfaces besides pool tile?</h3>
                <p>Yes!  We provide bead blasting services for natural and artificial rock, flagstone, brick and more!</p>
           <h3>Do you have to drain the water from my swimming pool?</h3>
                <p>WE DO NOT HAVE TO EMPTY YOUR SWIMMING POOL! (This process can be performed year round!) Instead, we lower the water level to just below the calcium line (about 6”). This gives us enough room to be able to perform the pool tile cleaning and get great results. The water will be drained using one of our industrial grade pumps that will lead to a drain in your front yard or street, depending on your preference and city code. When we’re finished with the pool tile cleaning, we’ll restore the water level back to its original position.</p>
           <h3>How long will my pool tiles stay clean?</h3>
                <p>This really depends on how well you maintain your pool and the type of water you use. Typically, your swimming pool will benefit from a weekly maintenance program and a pool tile cleaning service every year.</p>
           <h3>Do I have to be home during the pool tile cleaning?</h3>
                <p>You do not have to be home during the pool tile cleaning process. All we need is access to your pool and a water source.</p>
           <h3>What about my kids?  My pets?</h3>
                <p>Although the glass beads are safe and environmentally friendly, we do ask that you keep people and pets away from the pool during the pool tile bead blasting process due to the nature of the equipment that we use for pool tile cleaning.</p>
           <h3>How much does pool tile bead blasting cost?</h3>
                <p>The cost depends on the size of your pool and the severity of the build-up. We provide each of our clients with a free pool tile cleaning quote customized to fit your needs.</p>
           <h3>What are my payment options?</h3>
                <p>We currently accept cash or check at time of the pool tile cleaning service.</p>
